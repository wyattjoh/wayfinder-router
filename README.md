Wayfinder looks at a prompt's structure (length, headings, lists, code) and its
wording (proofs, math, hard constraints), then tells you whether to send it to your
small local model or your big cloud one. It decides in microseconds, runs offline,
and never calls another model to make the call: no API key, no network, no model
call to decide. You get a score and a recommendation, and what you do with it is up
to you.

Cheap prompts stay local and hard ones go to the expensive model, so you stop paying
top-tier prices for "summarize this" and "fix my typo."

## How it compares

Most routers decide by calling a model: a trained classifier, an LLM judge, or a
hosted API. That adds latency, cost, and randomness to the exact step meant to save
you money. Wayfinder reads structure and wording instead, so the decision is free
and the same every time.

| router | decides by | model call? | self-host | calibrate |
| --- | --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Wayfinder** | deterministic structural score | **no** | **yes** | **yes** |
| RouteLLM | trained classifier (preference data) | yes | yes | retrain |
| NotDiamond / Martian | learned, hosted | yes | no | via platform |
| OpenRouter (Auto) | hosted auto-router | yes | no | — |
| Bifrost / LiteLLM | provider gateway (not complexity-routed) | no | yes | n/a |

The gateways in the last two rows (OpenRouter, Bifrost, LiteLLM) answer a different
question: *which provider* serves a call, by price, availability, and failover.
Wayfinder answers *which tier a prompt deserves*: cheap vs expensive, by difficulty,
decided offline. The two compose. Run Wayfinder to make the cheap-vs-expensive call,
and a gateway underneath to reach the providers.

Wayfinder is not chasing a top accuracy number. What it gives you is a routing
decision you can run offline, with no model call, and tune on your own traffic. By
default it scores prompt *structure* only. It can also read lexical cues (proofs,
math, constraints), but those ship **off by default**: a
[double-blind test](benchmarks/blind-eval.md) on independently-authored prompts
showed the lexical lift does *not* generalize (it catches ~20% of unseen hard
prompts and loses to a plain word-count baseline), so they are opt-in. Raise their
weights only if you've calibrated them to your own traffic's vocabulary. A prompt
whose difficulty is purely semantic (a subtle code snippet, an innocent-looking
"what is the 100th prime number?") has no structural tell, and a semantic router
will beat it there. What holds up under the blind test is the part to rely on: a
deterministic, sub-millisecond, offline routing decision with no model call. The
[benchmark](benchmarks/README.md) (`make benchmark`) shows where it wins and where
it loses, against honest baselines and a perfect oracle. Point it at RouterBench or
RouterArena for graded numbers.

New here, or weighing it up? The [FAQ](docs/faq.md) gives straight answers —
including where it loses (it's no better than random on RouterBench's short-but-hard
items) and why you'd still run it.

## Try the demo (no keys)

Two ways to see the routing decision for yourself — no API keys, no models, nothing on the network.

**In your terminal**, a decision-first chat in the Wayfinder palette. The Rust port
builds the current TUI surface from source:

```bash
cargo run --bin wayfinder-router -- chat --dry-run --why "Summarise this in one sentence."
# or after `cargo build --release --bin wayfinder-router`:
./target/release/wayfinder-router chat --dry-run "What is DNS?"
```

![Wayfinder terminal chat — a routed prompt, the decision, the reply, and the running savings](docs/tui-chat.png)

The current Rust TUI prints the prompt, route, score, and mode. Add `--why` for
the feature breakdown, pass prompt text as arguments or stdin, and use `/route`,
`/local`, `/cloud`, `/auto`, `/threads`, `/load <id>`, and `/save <id>` in scripted
or piped input.

**In your browser**, the Rust gateway serves the same `/demo` page. Run it in
decision-only mode when you want zero keys and no upstream calls:

```bash
cargo run --bin wayfinder-router -- serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8088 --dry-run
# open http://127.0.0.1:8088/demo
```

`serve` is the supported Rust gateway command. It exposes `/healthz`,
`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, `/v1/models`, `/metrics`, `/router`, and `/demo`.
With `--dry-run`, the gateway returns routing decisions without calling upstream models.

The PyPI package is still present for legacy Python API users and Python-only commands
that have not moved to Rust yet, including `route`, `calibrate`, `init`, `doctor`, `ui`,
`onboard`, `judge`, and `recalibrate`. The current Rust support is intentionally limited
to the gateway service and TUI.

## Works with any OpenAI-compatible API

Wayfinder forwards each call to an OpenAI-style `/chat/completions` endpoint — so if
your provider speaks that (and most do), **it just works.** A tier is one `base_url`,
a model name, and a key read from the environment at request time; no SDK, no
per-provider code. Pair a free local model with a hosted one, or run two cloud tiers.

that takes a Bearer key.</sub>

</div>

## Quickstart

Put Wayfinder in front of your models. Your app keeps speaking the OpenAI API; you
just change one `base_url`.

1. Describe your two models in `wayfinder-router.toml`:

   ```toml
   [routing]
   threshold = 0.5            # below -> local, at/above -> cloud

   [gateway.models.local]
   base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
   model = "llama3.2"

   [gateway.models.cloud]
   base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
   model = "gpt-4o"
   api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"   # read from this env var, never stored
   # api_key_cmd = "op read op://Private/OpenAI/credential"  # optional: fill it from a vault
   ```

   Wayfinder never stores secrets: a model names an env var (`api_key_env`) and the key
   is read from your environment at request time. There is nothing to "install" — just
   export the variable. Prefer not to paste a raw key into your shell? Add an optional
   `api_key_cmd` and Wayfinder fills that variable from your secret store at startup —
   `op read …` (1Password), `security …` (macOS Keychain), `secret-tool …` (Linux),
   `pass`/`gopass`, `vault kv get …`, `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value …`, `bw`,
   `doppler`, `gcloud secrets …`, or any command that prints the secret. The key is held
   in memory only, still never written to disk.

   Legacy Python package users can still run `wayfinder-router init` and
   `wayfinder-router doctor` from the PyPI CLI to scaffold and inspect this file.

2. Set your key(s), then run the gateway. Legacy Python package users can run
   `wayfinder-router doctor` first to check whether each model's key resolves:

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...     # or OPENAI_API_KEY, per your config
   cargo run --bin wayfinder-router -- serve --port 8088
   # or: ./target/release/wayfinder-router serve --port 8088
   ```

3. Point your existing client at it. No code change:

   ```python
   client = openai.OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8088/v1", api_key="unused")
   client.chat.completions.create(model="auto", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}])
   ```

Easy prompts go local, hard ones go cloud, and every response carries
`x-wayfinder-router-model` and `x-wayfinder-router-score` so you can see where it
went. Want to force a tier for one request? Set `model="local"` or `"cloud"` (or
`prefer-local` / `prefer-hosted`), move the cut for a single call with an
`X-Wayfinder-Threshold` header, or start a chat message with `/local` or `/cloud`
(see [Steer a single request](#steer-a-single-request)).

Check it's working:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8088/healthz
# {"status":"ok","models":["cloud","local"]}

curl -s -D - -o /dev/null http://localhost:8088/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"auto","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}' \
  | grep -i x-wayfinder-router
# x-wayfinder-router-model: local
# x-wayfinder-router-score: 0.00
```

No backends yet? `wayfinder-router serve --dry-run` answers with the routing
decision instead of calling an upstream, so you can feel the routing in 30 seconds
before wiring up real models.

## Install

| command | what you get |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo build --release --bin wayfinder-router` | current Rust CLI binary with `serve` and `chat` |
| `./target/release/wayfinder-router serve --port 8088` | Rust OpenAI-compatible gateway service |
| `./target/release/wayfinder-router chat --dry-run "hello"` | Rust TUI routing preview with no keys |
| `docker build -t wayfinder-router .` | container image that builds and runs the Rust gateway binary |
| `pip install wayfinder-router` | scorer, CLI, Python API, **and the terminal chat** (`chat`); the scorer/library imports stay dependency-light |
| `pip install "wayfinder-router[gateway]"` | adds the OpenAI-compatible routing gateway, the common case for serving |
| `pip install "wayfinder-router[ui]"` | adds the local calibrate / explain / configure UI |
| `pip install "wayfinder-router[all]"` | gateway and UI on top of the default install |

The Rust CLI is not a public Rust library promise. The supported Rust surfaces are
the gateway service (`serve`) and the TUI (`chat`). The Python/PyPI package remains
available for the Python API and for legacy commands that are not yet implemented
in Rust.

## How it works

Wayfinder sits behind whatever OpenAI-compatible client you already use. You point
that client's `base_url` at the gateway once, and from then on it is invisible. The
same client serves a request whether it routes local or hosted.

```text
  your client   (chat app, IDE, agent, or code)
       |
       v
  Wayfinder gateway   scores, picks a model
       |
       |-- low  -->  local    (Ollama, vLLM)
       |-- high -->  hosted   (OpenAI, any /v1)
       |
       v
  response returns via the same client,
  with x-wayfinder-router-* headers
```

A few things follow from this:

- **The interface in front is yours.** A chat GUI (Open WebUI, LibreChat), an IDE
  assistant with a custom endpoint (Cursor, Continue), an agent framework, or your
  own code on the OpenAI SDK. Want a chat window today? Put Open WebUI in front and
  point it at the gateway.
- **Local and hosted are backends, not apps.** The local model is just a server
  (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp) speaking OpenAI's `/v1`; the hosted one is
  the same shape. The user never switches UIs and usually never knows which model
  answered.
- **The score is computed, not a second opinion.** Asking a model how hard a
  prompt is would be slow, non-deterministic, and would cost a model call to decide
  whether to make a model call. Wayfinder scans the prompt instead — structure
  (length, headings, steps, links, code, tables) and difficulty cues in the wording
  (reasoning terms, math symbols, constraints) — into a `0.0`-`1.0` value and
  compares it to your threshold. Same prompt, same threshold, same answer. It is a
  proxy for difficulty, not a verdict, which is why the threshold is yours to tune.

Keys are read from the environment at request time and never touch the config file
or the scored path.

## Score a prompt from the CLI

```bash
echo "Summarise this paragraph in one sentence." | wayfinder-router route -
```

```text
Recommended Model: local
Complexity Score: 0.00  (mode: tiered)

Tiers:
  >= 0.00  local <-
  >= 0.50  cloud

Contributing Features:
  Word Count: 6
  ...
```

Add `--json` for machine consumers (an agent reads this and routes to its own
model):

```json
{
  "schema_version": "3",
  "score": 0.66,
  "recommendation": "cloud",
  "mode": "tiered",
  "features": { "word_count": 545, "heading_count": 12, "reasoning_term_count": 3, "...": 0 },
  "tiers": [{ "min_score": 0.0, "model": "local" }, { "min_score": 0.5, "model": "cloud" }]
}
```

## Configure routing

Wayfinder reads its own `wayfinder-router.toml`, found by walking up from where you
run it. There are three modes, in precedence order (classifier > tiers >
threshold); the scalar-score `weights` apply to any of them.

**Binary** (the default) is a single cut:

```toml
[routing]
threshold = 0.6
weights = { word_count = 4.0, list_item_count = 2.5 }
```

`--threshold N` overrides it for one run; `WAYFINDER_ROUTER_THRESHOLD` overrides it
from the environment.

To switch the lexical cues on, raise their `weights` and cut at the knee — the one
held-out improvement over the structural default on real frontier traffic (skill
−0.038 → +0.057, 61% cost saved on RouterBench). See
[`docs/lexical-routing.md`](docs/lexical-routing.md) and the ready-to-edit
[`examples/wayfinder-router.lexical.toml`](examples/wayfinder-router.lexical.toml);
recalibrate the threshold to your own traffic (a ~20-prompt bootstrap is only a smoke
test — see [`benchmarks/calibration-eval.md`](benchmarks/calibration-eval.md)).

**Tiered** routes ordered score bands to any number of models:

```toml
[[routing.tiers]]
min_score = 0.0
model = "llama-3b"
[[routing.tiers]]
min_score = 0.3
model = "llama-70b"
[[routing.tiers]]
min_score = 0.6
model = "claude-cloud"
```

**Classifier** is a fitted multinomial-logistic model, `argmax` over per-model
linear scores. You usually generate it with `calibrate` rather than write it by
hand.

Each `[gateway.models.<name>]` block maps a routed name to an upstream `base_url`, a
`model`, and an optional `api_key_env` (the name of an environment variable, never
the secret itself). The gateway is the only part that touches keys or the network;
the scorer, config, and calibrator stay pure and offline.

## Calibrate on your data

The cut is a proxy, so tune it against your own traffic. `wayfinder-router
calibrate` reads a labeled JSONL dataset (`{"text": ..., "label": ...}`) and prints
a config fragment. It runs offline and never calls a model; the labels are your
ground truth.

```bash
wayfinder-router calibrate data.jsonl --mode threshold              # sweep the binary cut
wayfinder-router calibrate data.jsonl --mode tiers                  # ordinal multi-model
wayfinder-router calibrate data.jsonl --mode classifier --out wayfinder-router.toml
```

The fragment drops straight into `wayfinder-router.toml`; the accuracy and chosen
breakpoints print to stderr. The classifier is fit by deterministic L2-regularized
Newton/IRLS, pure Python, converging in a handful of iterations.

To pick a cut in cost terms instead of bare accuracy, use a cost-aware objective.
`--objective knee` chooses the cost-aware knee automatically (it maximizes
quality-recovered × cost-saved — no target to guess, and it can't collapse to
always-routing-to-the-expensive-model the way pure accuracy does on skewed labels);
`--objective cost-quality --target-savings X` instead holds a specific savings floor.
Add `--weights` to score with — and emit — custom feature weights, e.g. the lexical
opt-in, so the output is a complete, deployable config (see
[`docs/lexical-routing.md`](docs/lexical-routing.md)):

```bash
wayfinder-router calibrate data.jsonl --mode threshold --objective knee \
  --costs local=0.2,cloud=1.0 \
  --weights reasoning_term_count=5,math_symbol_count=3,constraint_term_count=1.5
```

Cost is metadata only — it shapes the calibrated cut and is reported on the
`/metrics` endpoint, but never enters a per-request decision, which stays
deterministic and free.

### Steer a single request

The deployment's config sets the default boundary, but a client can override the
decision for one request over plain OpenAI transport. An override only changes
where the request goes; the prompt is still scored, and nothing adds a model call.

- **The `model` field is a routing directive.** `auto` (or any normal model id)
  lets Wayfinder decide; a configured endpoint name (`local`, `cloud`) pins the
  request there; `prefer-local` / `prefer-hosted` pin to the low / high end of your
  router (`prefer-cloud` still works as an alias of `prefer-hosted`).
- **An `X-Wayfinder-Threshold` header re-cuts the decision** for that request, a
  number in `0.0`-`1.0` reusing your weights (binary routers only).
- **An in-message `/directive`** (opt-in: `[gateway] slash_directives = true`) lets a
  plain chat box steer routing — start a message with `/local`, `/cloud`, `/prefer-hosted`,
  or `/auto` and it pins that turn (stripped before the model sees it). Only known
  directives are acted on; anything else starting with `/` is left as ordinary text
  (WF-ADR-0036).

```python
# Pin one call to cloud regardless of score:
client.chat.completions.create(model="cloud", messages=[...])
# Or move the cut for one call (keep model="auto"):
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto", messages=[...], extra_headers={"X-Wayfinder-Threshold": "0.8"}
)
```

Each response adds `x-wayfinder-router-mode` (`scored` / `pinned` /
`threshold-override`) next to the `-model` and `-score` headers, so you can see
which channel decided the route.

## Drive it from a chat UI (no fork)

Because the `model` field is a routing directive, any OpenAI-compatible chat UI can
drive routing with no code change: the app's normal model dropdown becomes a
per-conversation routing picker (`auto` / `prefer-local` / `prefer-hosted` / a
pinned endpoint). The gateway lists these at `GET /v1/models`, so a UI discovers
them on its own.

- **LibreChat** — copy [`examples/librechat.yaml`](examples/librechat.yaml) and
  [`examples/docker-compose.override.yml`](examples/docker-compose.override.yml)
  into your checkout, run `docker compose up`, and pick the "Wayfinder" endpoint.
- **Open WebUI** — add an OpenAI connection pointing at the gateway; it
  auto-discovers the routing options.

See [`examples/`](examples/) for both. The one thing a stock UI can't express is a
live per-conversation threshold slider; that's what the `wayfinder-chat` fork adds,
and this no-fork path proves it out first.

## See where requests go

Wayfinder's controls are spread across the tools you already run, so it's easy not
to notice it working. Four surfaces show or steer routing:

| surface | what it shows | where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model dropdown | the routing picker (`auto` / `prefer-local` / `prefer-hosted` / a pinned endpoint) | your client, from `GET /v1/models` |
| Response headers | where each request went and why (`-model` / `-score` / `-mode` / `-request-id`) | every response |
| Debug body field | the decision inside the response body, opt-in | request header `X-Wayfinder-Debug: true` |
| Dashboard | recent decisions, per-model counts, scores — metadata only, never prompt text | `GET /router` (JSON at `/router/recent`) |

The dashboard is separate from the off-path `wayfinder-router ui` console, which is
for tuning, not production traffic.

## Learn from feedback

Don't guess the cut, learn it from your own judgment of local versus hosted output.
The loop is: collect judgments, calibrate, route automatically.

Bootstrap it with A/B onboarding. For each sample prompt, `wayfinder-router
onboard` runs both arms and asks which was good enough; the answer is a label:

```bash
wayfinder-router onboard prompts.jsonl --arms local,cloud --calibrate > wayfinder-router.toml
```

The comparison goes to stderr; `--calibrate` prints the resulting config to stdout.
Each judgment appends a `{"text", "label"}` line to a feedback log, which is itself
the `calibrate` dataset, so the log turns straight into a config.

To skip the manual grading, let `wayfinder-router judge` label automatically. It runs
both tiers and asks an automated judge *"was the cheaper tier good enough?"* — the same
sufficiency question, no person in the loop:

```bash
wayfinder-router judge prompts.jsonl --arms local,cloud --gold gold.jsonl > wayfinder-router.toml
```

The built-in judge is a deterministic text comparator that **abstains** rather than guess
when it can't tell. Because a bad label would silently degrade live routing, `judge` will
only emit a config once it **passes trust gates** — agreement with your human-labeled
`--gold` set (Cohen's κ ≥ 0.6), out-of-fold lift over the majority baseline, and both arms
represented. If the gates fail it prints the confusion matrix and refuses (the labels are
still recorded). Pass `--save-comparisons out.jsonl` to also keep the raw responses (off by
default — it's a body store).

Once you're routing automatically, keep it honest by recording which model was
actually good enough:

```bash
curl localhost:8088/v1/feedback -d '{"text": "...", "label": "cloud"}'
```

Then re-fit on a schedule from cron, a k8s CronJob, or a click in the UI.
Recalibration rewrites only the `[routing]` section and preserves your `[gateway]`
endpoints, and a running gateway hot-reloads the result with no restart:

```bash
wayfinder-router recalibrate                  # log -> calibrate -> write config
wayfinder-router recalibrate --min-labels 50  # no-op until you have enough signal
```

The judging runs models, so it lives in the gateway layer (with your key); the
scoring core stays untouched and the log carries no secrets.

## Deploy and integrate

The gateway is the current production service surface. In production, prompts flow
through the Rust gateway, so routing happens where prompts already are. The Python
library remains available for in-process scoring in legacy Python integrations.

Run the gateway as a service, sidecar or standalone:

```bash
docker build -t wayfinder-router . && docker run -p 8088:8088 -v "$PWD/data:/data" wayfinder-router
# or: docker compose up gateway   # see docker-compose.example.yml
```

Point your existing client at it with no app change. Anything that speaks the
OpenAI API takes a `base_url`, including agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex),
IDE assistants with a custom endpoint (Cursor, Continue), and gateways like LiteLLM:

```python
client = openai.OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8088/v1", api_key="unused")
```

See **[Integration recipes](docs/integrations.md)** for copy-paste setup across chat UIs
(Open WebUI, LibreChat, Jan), editors (Continue, Cline, Zed, JetBrains), agent frameworks
(LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, AutoGen, the OpenAI Agents SDK, the Vercel AI SDK), and
CLIs (aider, Copilot CLI) — plus the canonical `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` pair.

**Claude Code** speaks Anthropic's Messages API rather than OpenAI's, so the gateway exposes a
`POST /v1/messages` adapter (WF-DESIGN-0011) that translates Anthropic ⇄ OpenAI in both
directions — streaming and tool use included. Point it at the gateway root and Claude Code
routes through Wayfinder like any other client:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8088"   # client appends /v1/messages
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="unused"                   # the gateway uses each upstream's own key
claude
```

For the Rust gateway, wire your clients to the OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible
routes and inspect routing through response headers, `/metrics`, `/router`, and
`/router/recent`.

Legacy Python package users can still wire feedback from wherever users are. Your
app, IDE, or chat shows a thumbs-up or thumbs-down and posts the judgment; the next
recalibration learns from it:

```js
fetch("http://localhost:8088/v1/feedback", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ text: prompt, label: wasGoodEnough ? "local" : "cloud" }),
});
```

The Rust gateway forwards asynchronously and streams: a request with `stream: true`
comes back as Server-Sent-Events, so chat clients render tokens as they arrive. An
upstream timeout or connection failure returns an OpenAI-shaped error instead of a
bare 500, every response carries a request id for tracing, and routing decisions
are visible in headers and metrics. Current Rust gateway knobs:

| setting | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `serve --timeout` | upstream timeout in seconds (default 60) |
| `serve --dry-run` | return routing decisions without calling any upstream |
| `GET /healthz` | reports service health and configured model ids |
| `GET /router` | read-only dashboard of recent decisions, with `X-Wayfinder-Debug: true` surfacing one in the body |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus text for decisions, upstream errors, cost counters, cache, rate limits, and key usage |
| `[gateway.cache] enabled` / `ttl` / `max_entries` / `max_bytes` | exact-match response cache. Off by default; in-memory only. A hit is surfaced via `x-wayfinder-router-cache: hit\|miss`; disabling purges it (WF-ADR-0033) |
| `[gateway] retries` / `breaker_threshold` / `breaker_cooldown` / `failover` plus per-model `fallbacks` / `context_window` | retry transient upstream failures, skip tripped targets, and serve configured same-tier fallbacks without recomputing the routing decision. Failover is surfaced via `x-wayfinder-router-served-by`, `x-wayfinder-router-failover`, and `wayfinder_router_failovers_total` (WF-ADR-0031) |
| `[gateway.rate_limit] rpm` / `tpm` / `window` | cap requests-per-minute and/or upstream-tokens-per-minute over a fixed `window` (default 60s); on breach returns `429` with `Retry-After`. The outermost guardrail (checked before scoring); gateway-wide. Successful responses carry `X-RateLimit-Limit`/`-Remaining`/`-Reset` so clients can self-pace; surfaced via `x-wayfinder-router-rate-limit` and `wayfinder_router_rate_limited_total` (WF-ADR-0034) |
| `[gateway.keys.<id>] hash` | virtual API keys: when any is set, `/v1/*` requires a valid `Authorization: Bearer` token (else `401`). Store only a SHA-256 hash. Requests are attributed via `wayfinder_router_key_requests_total` (WF-ADR-0035) |

Feedback, spend budgets, and key minting commands remain Python/PyPI surfaces
until they are ported or retired.

## Explain and tune

To see why a prompt routed where it did, ask for the per-feature breakdown: each
feature's value, its normalized level, its weight, and its share of the score.

```bash
wayfinder-router route prompt.md --explain
```

For interactive tuning there's a local web UI:

- **Explain** — paste a prompt; see the score, the tier ladder, and contribution
  bars, and drag a threshold slider to watch routing change live.
- **Calibrate** — paste a labeled dataset, run a mode, and see accuracy, the sweep
  curve, and the resulting config fragment.
- **Configure** — edit `wayfinder-router.toml` with live validation and save.
- **Onboard** — A/B a local and a hosted model in the browser, judge each, and
  calibrate from the log (needs `[gateway]` for the model calls).

```bash
pip install "wayfinder-router[ui]"
wayfinder-router ui --port 8099    # then open http://localhost:8099
```

The UI is a thin wrapper over the same pure functions; it never calls a model, and
no secret appears in it.

## Python API

```python
from wayfinder_router import score_complexity, RoutingConfig, explain_score

result = score_complexity(prompt_text, config=RoutingConfig.binary(threshold=0.7))
print(result.recommendation, result.score, result.features)
for fc in explain_score(result.features, RoutingConfig().weights):
    print(fc.name, fc.contribution)
```

## Origin

Wayfinder started as a `route` experiment inside a larger requirements tool and was
split out because routing is a runtime concern, not a knowledge one: a prompt router
shouldn't make you install an engine you don't need. The result is a small, focused
tool whose scoring core stays dependency-free — you can `import wayfinder_router` and
score prompts with nothing but the standard library (WF-ADR-0001, WF-ADR-0029).

## Repository layout

This fork's product is the Rust workspace. The Python package is upstream's, kept for the
toolchain that has not been ported yet (see the Fork notice at the top).
