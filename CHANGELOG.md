# Changelog

User-visible changes to Wayfinder, by release. Follows the spirit of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/): user impact over implementation
details, release history over commit history.

## Unreleased

The **feedback release** — features driven by post-launch feedback.

### Added

- **A config-editing seam in the CLI** (WF-ADR-0044). Four whitelisted verbs mutate
  `wayfinder-router.toml` without you hand-editing TOML, and without a client ever authoring it:
  `config set gateway.offline true|false` (the one scalar today; the whitelist grows key by key,
  never into a general editor), `config add-model` to register any OpenAI-compatible endpoint,
  `config set-model` to enable/disable a model or set its fallback, and `config set-threshold` to
  move a tier's score boundary. Every edit is **line-preserving** (comments and unrelated sections
  survive byte-for-byte) and **schema-validated** — the result is re-parsed through the real config
  parsers before a single byte is written, so the seam never leaves you with a file the gateway
  wouldn't load. `config set` is hot-reloaded by a running gateway on its next request;
  `add-model`/`set-model` need a restart. A newly added model is visible on `/router/models` and
  keyable immediately, but stays out of the scored routing ladder until you place it in a tier by
  hand.
- **A fixed config file for service-managed gateways** (WF-ADR-0042). `serve --config PATH` and the
  `WAYFINDER_CONFIG` environment variable point the gateway at one well-known file instead of
  walking up from a working directory a launchd/systemd unit doesn't control; `service install
  --config PATH` bakes it into the generated unit. Resolution is `--config`, then `WAYFINDER_CONFIG`,
  then the walk-up, then defaults — and a named-but-missing file is an error, never a silent
  fall-back to defaults.
- **A no-backend gateway answers with the routing decision** (WF-ADR-0042). A live gateway with no
  `[gateway.models]` configured now returns the routing decision from `/v1/chat/completions`
  (HTTP 200, plus an `x-wayfinder-router-decision-only` header) instead of an error, so you see real
  routing the instant the gateway is up — before wiring any backend. Only delivery is skipped; the
  decision is byte-identical to a dry run.
- **Per-model on/off switch.** A model can be marked `enabled = false` (or toggled via `config
  set-model --enabled`). A disabled model is skipped at delivery like a broken endpoint, cascading
  to its fallback — the scored decision is never affected.
- **macOS Keychain-backed keys from `init`.** `wayfinder-router init --keychain` (and `config
  add-model --keychain`) writes an `api_key_cmd` per keyed model that reads the key from the macOS
  Keychain at request time; the key itself is never written to the config.
- **`init` creates missing parent directories**, so `init --path some/new/dir/wayfinder-router.toml`
  works from a fresh checkout without a manual `mkdir -p`.
- **Automated sufficiency judge for calibration** (WF-ADR-0037). `wayfinder-router judge
  prompts.jsonl --gold gold.jsonl` closes the calibration loop without a human grading every
  prompt: it runs each prompt through two tiers, asks an automated judge *"was the cheaper tier
  good enough to skip the dearer one?"*, and records the answer as a label that `calibrate`
  already consumes. The built-in `HeuristicJudge` is a pure, deterministic text comparator
  (refusal/error detection, agreement, similarity) that **abstains** rather than guess when it
  can't tell. Because a bad label silently degrades *live* routing, a config is **untrusted until
  it clears mandatory gates** — judge-vs-gold Cohen's κ (≥ 0.6), out-of-fold cross-validated lift
  over the majority baseline, and a degenerate-collapse check; on failure the command prints the
  confusion matrix and refuses to emit a config (the labels are still recorded). Emitted configs
  carry a provenance banner (judge version, dataset/gold hashes, the gates that passed). All
  judging is offline / calibration-time in the invocation layer — the deterministic decision path
  makes no model call (WF-ADR-0001). Saving raw prompts+responses (`--save-comparisons`) is off by
  default (a governed response-body store, WF-DESIGN-0008). An LLM-backed judge is a planned
  drop-in through the same `Judge` seam.

### Changed

- **`[[routing.tiers]]` must be declared in ascending `min_score` order.** Tier order is the routing
  ladder order, so the declared order is now authoritative: an out-of-order ladder is rejected
  rather than silently sorted into shape. Configs written by `init` or `calibrate` are already in
  order; only a hand-edited file with out-of-order tiers is affected.
- **`/router/models` reports more per model.** Each entry now carries `provider`
  (`openai-compatible`), `tier`, `context_window`, and `enabled`, so a client can render a model's
  delivery identity and state without guessing. `/router/recent` additionally reports `decision_ms`
  per entry and `p50_decision_ms` over the recent window — the time to *decide* a route, never the
  upstream model's own response time.
- **Docs & positioning pass** (from post-launch feedback). Plainer, less marketing-flavored copy
  across the README, explainer, and demo. The "How it compares" table now lists **Bifrost**
  alongside LiteLLM and spells out the distinction: OpenRouter / Bifrost / LiteLLM are
  multi-provider gateways (they pick *which provider* serves a call), while Wayfinder routes by
  prompt *difficulty* (cheap vs expensive) and decides offline — and the two compose. Forcing a
  tier for one request (`local` / `cloud`, `prefer-local` / `prefer-hosted`, the
  `X-Wayfinder-Threshold` header, or a `/local` / `/cloud` chat directive) is now surfaced in the
  Quickstart. No behavior change.

## v2026.6.9 — 2026-06-25

### Added

- **In-message slash routing directives** (WF-ADR-0036). With `[gateway] slash_directives = true`
  (off by default), a recognized `/directive` at the start of the latest user message forces the
  route for that turn — `/local refactor this` pins to `local`, `/prefer-hosted …` to the top tier,
  `/auto …` back to scoring. It lets anyone steer routing from a plain chat box (or Claude Code,
  via `/v1/messages`) with no `model` field or header control. The directive is **stripped** before
  the prompt is scored or forwarded, so the model never sees it. Only a *known* directive (a
  configured model name, `prefer-*`, or `auto`) is acted on — a path like `/etc/...`, a `/help`, or
  any other slash-prefixed text is left untouched. An explicit `model`-field pin still wins; a
  slash-routed turn reports `mode: slash-pinned` and is still clamped by a virtual key's model
  allowlist. Deterministic, no model call (WF-ADR-0001).

## v2026.6.8 — 2026-06-25

A small hardening on top of v2026.6.7 (and the first build of all of v2026.6.7's gateway
work to reach PyPI).

### Added

- **Informational `X-RateLimit-*` response headers** (WF-ADR-0034). When a rate limit is
  configured, every response now carries `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and
  `X-RateLimit-Reset` (seconds until the window rolls), so a well-behaved client can see its
  headroom and self-pace *before* hitting a `429`. The headers reflect the tightest applicable
  request cap — gateway-wide or the request's virtual key — and are absent when no limit is set.
  Purely additive; no change to routing or enforcement.

## v2026.6.7 — 2026-06-25

The gateway becomes a control plane. It now issues **virtual API keys** — authenticate callers,
attribute spend *and savings* per team, and scope each key's budget, rate limit, and allowed
models — and completes the **guardrails trilogy** by adding RPM/TPM **rate limiting** alongside
budgets and an exact-match **response cache** for instant, free repeats. All opt-in and additive;
the scored decision stays deterministic and offline (WF-ADR-0001).

### Added

- **Virtual API keys — auth, attribution, and per-key budgets/limits** (WF-ADR-0035,
  WF-ROADMAP-0006). Issue scoped gateway credentials per team/app: `[gateway.keys.<id>]` stores a
  **SHA-256 hash** of the key (never the plaintext), minted with `wayfinder-router keys new`. When
  any key is configured, `/v1/*` (including Claude Code's `/v1/messages`) requires a valid
  `Authorization: Bearer` token — `401` otherwise; with no keys configured the gateway stays open
  (backward compatible). Each request is attributed to its key: in the `/router/recent` feed, in
  `wayfinder_router_key_requests_total{key=…}`, and — the FinOps payoff no competitor offers — as
  per-key realized/**savings** under `by_key` in `/v1/savings`. A key can carry its own
  `[gateway.keys.<id>.budget]`, `[gateway.keys.<id>.rate_limit]`, and a `models` allowlist; the
  key's cap and the gateway-wide cap both apply, strictest wins. A **`models` allowlist** restricts
  which configured models a key may use — if routing picks one the key isn't allowed, the request
  **clamps to the nearest allowed tier** (preferring not to raise cost, reported as
  `mode: key-scoped`) rather than failing. Hashed-in-config, hot-reloaded, deterministic, no model
  call (WF-ADR-0001); provider keys still come from your environment (WF-ADR-0004). Runtime
  create/revoke is a deferred follow-up.

- **Gateway rate limiting** (WF-ADR-0034, WF-ROADMAP-0006). An optional `[gateway.rate_limit]`
  that caps requests-per-minute (`rpm`) and/or upstream-tokens-per-minute (`tpm`) over a fixed
  `window` (default 60s); on breach the gateway returns **HTTP 429** with a
  `Retry-After` header, an `x-wayfinder-router-rate-limit: rpm|tpm` header, and a
  `wayfinder_router_rate_limited` error. It's the outermost guardrail — checked before scoring —
  so a runaway client or retry storm can't flood an upstream. A cache hit still counts as a
  request (RPM) but spends no upstream tokens (TPM); `/metrics` gains
  `wayfinder_router_rate_limited_total`. Gateway-wide in v1 (per-key limits arrive with virtual
  keys); pure deterministic counters, no model call (WF-ADR-0001). Completes the guardrails
  trilogy with budgets (cost) and the cache (repeats).
- **Exact-match response cache** (WF-ADR-0033, WF-ROADMAP-0006). An optional `[gateway.cache]`
  that replays a stored answer for an identical, deterministic request — instant, free repeats
  for eval/CI, dev loops, and agentic tools (it covers `/v1/messages`/Claude Code too). The key
  is a SHA-256 of the normalized request (the prompt is hashed, never stored), keyed on the
  served upstream model; the cache is **in-memory only, off by default**, and bounded by
  `ttl` (default 300s), `max_entries` (1024), and `max_bytes` (64 MiB) — raise `max_bytes` to
  give it more memory. A hit is **free**: it records no realized cost and doesn't consume a
  budget, and the cost it avoided is reported separately (`wayfinder_router_cache_avoided_cost_total`,
  plus `…_cache_hits_total` / `…_cache_misses_total`); every response carries
  `x-wayfinder-router-cache: hit|miss`. Only deterministic requests are cached (no streaming,
  `temperature` > 0, `tools`, `seed`, or `n` > 1), and an HTTP-200 error-shaped body is never
  stored. The scored decision is never recomputed (WF-ADR-0001). As the project's first
  response-body store it follows WF-DESIGN-0008's opt-in framing — disabling it purges the
  in-memory bodies immediately, and cached content is never logged or surfaced.

## v2026.6.6 — 2026-06-24

The gateway reaches further and spends safer. Point **Claude Code** at it with one
environment variable — a new Anthropic `/v1/messages` adapter translates Messages ⇄ Chat
Completions (streaming and tool use included) — and cap spend with **budgets** that degrade
to the cheapest tier on breach rather than failing. Both are pure additions around the same
deterministic router: scoring, failover, and the savings ledger are reused unchanged, and
the scored decision stays offline (WF-ADR-0001).

### Added

- **Claude Code adapter — an Anthropic `/v1/messages` endpoint** (WF-DESIGN-0011, WF-ROADMAP-0006).
  Point `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at the gateway and Claude Code (or any Anthropic-Messages-native
  client) routes through Wayfinder. The endpoint translates the Anthropic Messages format to the
  OpenAI Chat Completions the gateway already speaks and back again — both directions, buffered
  **and streaming**, including **tool use** (`tools`/`tool_choice`, `tool_use`/`tool_result`, and
  streamed tool calls). It is pure format translation: scoring, budgets, and failover are the
  *existing* router, reused unchanged, so the same `x-wayfinder-router-*` decision headers ride
  along and there is exactly one routing decision (WF-ADR-0001). Image/vision blocks, extended
  thinking, and prompt-caching controls are not translated yet. See the Claude Code recipe in
  [docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md).
- **Gateway spend budgets** (WF-ADR-0032, WF-ROADMAP-0006). An optional `[gateway.budget]`
  spend cap that, once the period's realized cost is reached, **degrades to the cheapest tier**
  rather than hard-failing — the same `degrade` primitive failover uses (WF-ADR-0031), so it
  keeps you working at lower cost. `limit` is the ceiling, `window` is `day` (default) | `month`
  | `all`, and `on_breach` is `degrade` (default) or `block` (refuse with HTTP 402,
  `wayfinder_router_budget_exhausted`). A breach is never silent: the response carries
  `x-wayfinder-router-budget: degraded` (or `blocked`) and a degrade reports
  `mode: budget-degraded` with the cheaper tier in `x-wayfinder-router-model` — while the
  `score` header still shows the true, unchanged complexity score (the cap reshapes routing,
  never the decision; WF-ADR-0001). Enforced only when real `cost_per_1k` prices are configured
  (`priced`); a relative-unit demo has no dollars to cap, so the budget is a no-op there.

## v2026.6.5 — 2026-06-23

The gateway grows up. It now **proves the savings** routing makes (a persisted,
per-period report vs always-frontier), is a **drop-in** for the tools you already use,
and is **production-reliable** — retries, same-tier fallback, a circuit breaker, and an
opt-in cross-tier failover policy. The terminal chat's `/cost` gains a cross-session
period view. All additive; routing stays deterministic and offline (WF-ADR-0001).

### Added

- **Savings report on the gateway** (WF-DESIGN-0007). `GET /v1/savings?period=today|7d|30d|all`
  returns realized vs always-frontier cost and the savings between them, with a per-route
  breakdown — computed deterministically from token counts (the upstream `usage` when present,
  else a labelled estimate) times your `cost_per_1k` price table; no model call. Figures are
  dollars when costs are configured (`priced: true`), else relative units. The report is
  persisted (best-effort, survives restarts) and pins a `price_table_version` so a number is
  auditable. `/metrics` gains `wayfinder_router_realized_cost_total`,
  `…_baseline_cost_total`, and `…_savings_cost_total`, and the `/router` decision feed now
  carries per-request cost metadata (dollars + token counts only — never prompt text).
- **Gateway path tolerance** (WF-DESIGN-0009). `/chat/completions` and `/models` now also
  answer without the `/v1` prefix, so a client whose `base_url` omits `/v1` still routes. New
  **[Integration recipes](docs/integrations.md)** cover chat UIs, editors, agent frameworks,
  and CLIs.
- **Gateway reliability — retries, same-tier fallback, circuit breaker** (WF-ADR-0031,
  WF-DESIGN-0010). A failed forward (transport error, or `429`/`5xx`) is retried with bounded
  backoff; on exhaustion it falls back to a model's configured `fallbacks` (same-tier
  alternate endpoints); a per-target circuit breaker skips a downed upstream until it cools
  down (then a `503` rather than hammering it). Ordinary `4xx` fails fast. Tunable via
  `[gateway] retries / breaker_threshold / breaker_cooldown` and per-model `fallbacks`.
  Responses carry `x-wayfinder-router-served-by` (and `x-wayfinder-router-failover` when it
  differs from the routed tier); cost is billed to the target that actually served. An
  opt-in **cross-tier `failover` policy** (`[gateway] failover = same-tier` (default) `|
  degrade | escalate`, per-request override via `X-Wayfinder-Failover`) can fall to a cheaper
  tier (`degrade`, never raises cost) or a dearer one (`escalate`, opt-in) once same-tier
  options are exhausted, and a **deterministic pre-call check** skips a target whose
  `context_window` can't fit the prompt before spending the call. The **scored decision is
  never recomputed** — this is delivery, not routing.
- **`/cost` period view in the terminal chat** (WF-DESIGN-0007). The chat now records turns
  into a persisted savings ledger, so `/cost` shows today / 7-day / 30-day / all-time savings
  (and route mix) that accrue across sessions, not just the current one.

## v2026.6.4 — 2026-06-23

More providers, safer keys. A one-command Google Gemini preset joins the `init`
lineup, and model keys can now be filled from your secret store at startup instead
of exporting raw secrets — keys are still read at request time and never written to
disk.

### Added

- **Model keys can come from your secret store.** A `[gateway.models]` entry may name an
  `api_key_cmd` (e.g. `op read op://Private/Anthropic/credential`) that fills its key
  **in memory** at startup when the environment variable is unset — so the secret can
  live in your password manager and never touch a shell file, config, or disk. An
  already-set variable always wins, so the command runs only when needed
  (WF-ADR-0004, WF-DESIGN-0006). `init` and `doctor` suggest a ready-to-edit command for
  whichever tools they find on your `PATH`: 1Password, macOS Keychain, Secret Service,
  `pass`, gopass, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Bitwarden, Doppler, and Google
  Secret Manager.
- **`/keys` in the terminal chat** re-resolves keys from your secret store and reports
  each model's status with fix-it hints, and the `/models` panel now notes
  command-resolved keys. A first-run nudge points you at `/keys` when a key is missing.
- **`init --preset gemini`** scaffolds a two-tier Google Gemini config
  (`gemini-2.5-flash` → `gemini-2.5-pro`) through Gemini's OpenAI-compatible endpoint,
  and the default `hybrid` preset gains a commented Gemini swap example. Gemini needs no
  special handling — it speaks the same OpenAI `/chat/completions` the gateway already
  forwards to (WF-ADR-0004).

## v2026.6.3 — 2026-06-22

Wayfinder moves to **calendar versioning** (`YYYY.M.MICRO`); this is the release that
the roadmap tracked as v0.3.0. It makes the terminal a first-class surface and adds
one-command setup.

### Added

- **`wayfinder-router chat` is a full-screen terminal app** (Textual): a scrolling
  transcript headed by the wordmark, inline `● LOCAL` / `◆ CLOUD` decisions with an
  expandable `/why` breakdown, a `/settings` panel, and streamed model replies. Two
  backends — in-process via `[gateway.models]`, or `--base-url` against a running
  gateway. Needs the `[tui]` extra (now rich **and** textual).
- **`wayfinder-router init`** scaffolds a starter `wayfinder-router.toml` (plus a
  `.env.example` of variable *names* only) from a preset (`hybrid` = keyless local
  Ollama → Anthropic cloud, or `openai` = gpt-4o-mini → gpt-4o) or interactively
  (`--interactive`), then reports which model keys resolve.
- **`wayfinder-router doctor`** checks the nearest config and whether each model's key
  is set (`✓ set` / `✗ not set` / `keyless`) — no server required.
- First-run nudges: `chat` and `webchat` point at `init` when no models are configured.

### Changed

- **Versioning is now CalVer (`YYYY.M.MICRO`).** The previous release was `v0.2.0`.
- Keys remain environment-only — `init`/`doctor` only ever name the variables to export;
  no secret is written, logged, or captured (WF-ADR-0004).

## v0.2.0 — 2026-06-19

This release adds cost-aware calibration and an opt-in lexical signal to the scorer.
Default routing is unchanged from v0.1.x — the new lexical features ship off.

### Added

- **Lexical difficulty signals in the scorer, opt-in / off by default**
  (WF-ADR-0016). The scorer computes and reports four new deterministic, offline
  features alongside the structural ones — `reasoning_term_count` (a curated lexicon
  of hard-task verbs and concepts — prove, derive, optimize, theorem, invariant,
  concurrency, …), `math_symbol_count` (math/logic glyphs and LaTeX-ish tokens),
  `constraint_term_count` (multi-constraint markers), and `question_count` — but they
  ship at **weight 0.0**, so they do not affect routing until you opt in. Why off: on
  the author's own prompts they lifted the cost-aware operating point from PGR 0.60 to
  0.80, but a [cross-provider double-blind test](benchmarks/blind-eval.md) showed the
  lift does not generalize — the lexicon fired on only ~20% of independently-authored
  hard prompts and lost to a plain word-count baseline. A curated keyword list detects
  an author's vocabulary, not difficulty in general. If your traffic uses a known
  vocabulary, raise these weights in your routing config and calibrate. Still no model
  call, no key, no network on the scored path (WF-ADR-0001).
- **Cost-aware routing** (WF-ADR-0017). Optional, informational cost metadata —
  `cost` on a `[[routing.tiers]]` entry and `cost_per_1k` on a `[gateway.models.*]`
  endpoint — surfaced on the `/metrics` endpoint as a gauge. A new calibration
  objective, `wayfinder-router calibrate --objective cost-quality --target-savings
  X [--costs local=0.2,cloud=1.0]`, picks the most accurate cut that still saves at
  least `X` against always-routing-high, and records the per-arm cost in the emitted
  config. Cost only moves *where the cut is placed* at calibration time and *what is
  reported*; it never enters the per-request decision, which stays deterministic and
  free. Live spend metering and token-level costing are explicitly out of scope.

### Changed

- **The JSON contract is now `schema_version` `"3"`** (was `"2"`). The `features`
  object gains the four lexical keys (reported, but weight 0.0 by default, so routing
  is unchanged); a tier in the JSON also carries `cost` when one is configured.
  Default routing decisions are **identical to v0.1.x** — the lexical features are
  off unless you opt in.

## v0.1.7 — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **A Prometheus `GET /metrics` endpoint** on the gateway (WF-ADR-0018): request
  counts by model and mode, decision-latency and upstream-latency histograms,
  upstream-error and config-reload-failure counters, and build info. Hand-rolled in
  the text exposition format with **no new dependency**, incremented at the same
  decision hook as the `/router` ring — so it carries **metadata only, never prompt
  text**, and stays off the scored path (no key, no model call, no network).

## v0.1.6 — 2026-06-18

### Added

- A **deterministic, offline benchmark** under `benchmarks/` (`make benchmark`,
  WF-ADR-0015) with metrics aligned to the routing literature (RouteLLM / RouterArena):
  quality, cost, call-fraction, performance-gap-recovered, cost savings, and decision
  latency, plus the full cost-quality curve. It reproduces byte-for-byte with no network
  or keys, ships honest baselines (always-local/cloud, stable-random, a tuned
  length-threshold, an oracle upper bound) and an illustrative dataset that **includes
  Wayfinder's failure mode**; point it at RouterBench / RouterArena for general numbers.
  Routers that need a model call to decide (RouteLLM, NotDiamond, …) get a pluggable
  adapter and a comparison citing their **published** numbers with provenance — never
  presented as ours.

### Changed

- README gains a **"How it compares"** section: the precise, defensible positioning (the
  only offline, zero-model-call, calibrate-on-your-data, self-hosted structural router),
  an honest comparison table, and a link to the reproducible benchmark.

## v0.1.5 — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **A read-only routing dashboard** (WF-ADR-0014). `GET /router` serves a tiny,
  self-contained page (no CDN, no build step) showing recent routing decisions, a
  per-model count, and scores at a glance; `GET /router/recent` is the JSON behind
  it. Decision **metadata only** — model, score, mode, request id, timestamp —
  never prompt text, kept in a bounded in-memory ring. It answers "is routing
  working?" without inspecting per-request headers, and is distinct from the
  off-path `wayfinder-router ui` operator console.
- **`X-Wayfinder-Debug: true`** (opt-in) surfaces the routing decision in the
  response — a `wayfinder` object in a non-streaming JSON body, or a trailing
  `wayfinder` SSE event on a stream — for clients that render the body but hide
  headers. The default response stays byte-clean.

## v0.1.4 — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Streaming responses** (WF-ADR-0013). A request with `stream: true` is relayed back
  as Server-Sent-Events so chat clients (LibreChat, Open WebUI, …) render tokens
  progressively. The gateway now forwards asynchronously (`httpx.AsyncClient`), so
  concurrent requests no longer block one another.
- `wayfinder-router serve --dry-run` returns the routing decision (model, score, mode)
  without calling any upstream — try the router with no backends configured.
- A configurable upstream timeout via `WAYFINDER_ROUTER_TIMEOUT` or `serve --timeout`
  (default 60s), and an optional `WAYFINDER_ROUTER_FEEDBACK_TOKEN` that gates the
  `/v1/feedback` write behind a bearer token to prevent label-log poisoning.
- Every response carries an `x-wayfinder-router-request-id`; routing decisions, upstream
  errors, and config-reload failures are logged. `GET /healthz` reports `degraded` and
  lists `missing_keys` when a configured `api_key_env` is unset.

### Changed

- Upstream transport failures (timeout, connection refused) now return an OpenAI-shaped
  `wayfinder_router_upstream_error` (a `502`, or a terminal SSE error event for a stream)
  instead of a bare `500` with a traceback. Scoring and the WF-ADR-0001/0004 boundary are
  unchanged.

## v0.1.3 — 2026-06-18

### Added

- The gateway serves **`GET /v1/models`**, an OpenAI-compatible discovery list of
  the selectable routing options — `auto`, `prefer-local` / `prefer-hosted` (for a
  tiered/binary router), and each configured `[gateway.models]` endpoint. Any
  OpenAI-compatible client now auto-populates its model dropdown with the routing
  modes, so no hand-written model list is needed. Like `/healthz` it reads config
  only — no key, no model call, no network (WF-ADR-0012).
- Integration examples under `examples/` for putting a chat UI in front of the
  gateway with no fork: a LibreChat custom-endpoint config (`librechat.yaml`) and a
  Compose override that runs the gateway as a LibreChat sidecar, plus Open WebUI
  connection notes. They lean on the per-request override (WF-ADR-0011) so a UI's
  model dropdown becomes a per-conversation routing-mode picker.

### Changed

- The high-end routing directive is now **`prefer-hosted`** (was `prefer-cloud`),
  matching the local/hosted language used elsewhere and because the high end of a
  router is not always literally "cloud". `prefer-cloud` keeps working as a silent
  back-compat alias. `prefer-local` / `prefer-hosted` apply to a tiered/binary
  router; under a classifier (which has no ordered ladder) they now fall through to
  scoring rather than pinning (WF-ADR-0011 amendment).

## v0.1.2 — unreleased

### Added

- The gateway accepts a **per-request routing override** so a client can steer a
  single call without changing the deployment's `wayfinder-router.toml`
  (WF-ADR-0011). The OpenAI `model` field is a routing directive — `auto` (or any
  ordinary model id) scores per config, a configured endpoint name pins the call
  to that endpoint, and `prefer-local` / `prefer-cloud` pin to the low / high end
  of the router — and an `X-Wayfinder-Threshold` header (a number in `0.0`–`1.0`)
  re-cuts a binary router for that one request. Responses gain an
  `x-wayfinder-router-mode` header (`scored` / `pinned` / `threshold-override`)
  alongside the existing `-model` / `-score` headers. The override only changes
  which endpoint a request routes to; scoring stays deterministic and key-free
  (WF-ADR-0001/0004).

## v0.1.1 — 2026-06-18

### Added

- An `all` install extra that pulls in the gateway and the UI in one step:
  `pip install "wayfinder-router[all]"` (equivalent to `[gateway,ui]`). The
  deterministic core stays zero-dependency (WF-ADR-0001); `all` is only a
  convenience aggregate of the existing optional extras.

### Changed

- Redesigned the local UI (`wayfinder-router ui`) as a branded, modern surface:
  a teal-on-cream/navy palette derived from the project banners, automatic light
  and dark themes (`prefers-color-scheme`), a wordmark + tagline header, carded
  sections, primary/secondary buttons, a custom-styled threshold slider, a
  recommendation pill, and refined tables and contribution bars. Presentation
  only — no behavior, endpoint, or dependency change (WF-ADR-0005).
- README install guidance now leads with `[gateway]` — the extra you need to
  route traffic through the proxy — clarifies that the bare install is the
  zero-dependency scorer/CLI/library, and documents `[all]`. Install snippets use
  the published `pip install "wayfinder-router[...]"` form.
- README gains a **"Where Wayfinder sits"** section — a diagram and explanation
  that Wayfinder is transparent middleware behind any OpenAI-compatible client
  (e.g. Open WebUI), and that local and hosted are *backends*, not separate UIs.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-18

The first public release. **Wayfinder** is a deterministic prompt-complexity
router: it scores a prompt's *structure* and recommends a **local** or **cloud**
model — offline, reproducible, and with no model call to make the decision. It
ships as its own product, **fully independent of RAC**: no `rac` import, no
`.rac/` reads, stdlib-only core, Python 3.11+. It was prototyped inside
requirements-as-code and split out because routing is a runtime *inference*
concern rather than recorded knowledge (RAC ADR-069/ADR-064); the scoring
boundary it inherits is RAC ADR-070, carried over intact. Apache-2.0.

### Added

- **Deterministic structural scorer and recommendation** (WF-ADR-0001).
  `wayfinder-router route` takes a prompt (file or stdin) and returns a bounded
  `0.0–1.0` complexity score over text *structure* — word count, headings and
  their depth, list items, links, code blocks, table rows — plus a local/cloud
  recommendation, as human output or JSON (`schema_version 2`). The same prompt
  and threshold always give the same answer; there is no model call, no API key,
  and no network in the scored path. A small `score_complexity` Python API backs
  the CLI, and the package ships typed (`py.typed`).

- **Tiered routing, a fitted classifier, and offline calibration**
  (WF-ADR-0002, WF-ADR-0003). Beyond the default binary cut, route by ordered
  score **tiers** to any number of models, or by a **multinomial-logistic
  classifier**. `wayfinder-router calibrate` turns a labeled JSONL dataset into a
  `wayfinder-router.toml` fragment — threshold sweep, tier sweep, or a classifier
  fit by deterministic L2-regularized Newton/IRLS (pure Python, no dependency,
  converges in a handful of iterations). Config is layered: `wayfinder-router.toml`
  walk-up, `--threshold`, and `WAYFINDER_ROUTER_THRESHOLD`.

- **OpenAI-compatible routing gateway, bring-your-own-key** (WF-ADR-0004).
  `wayfinder-router serve` runs a proxy that scores each incoming prompt and
  forwards it to the chosen upstream — point any OpenAI-compatible client's
  `base_url` at it, no application code change. Responses carry
  `x-wayfinder-router-model` and `x-wayfinder-router-score`. Keys are read from
  the environment at request time (each model's `api_key_env`), never stored in
  config or the scored path. Ships behind the `gateway` extra, lazily imported.

- **Local calibration / explain / configure UI** (WF-ADR-0005).
  `wayfinder-router ui` serves a local web app — **Explain** (per-feature
  contribution bars and a live threshold slider), **Calibrate** (paste a dataset,
  see accuracy and the sweep curve), **Configure** (edit `wayfinder-router.toml`
  with live validation), and **Onboard**. A thin consumer of the same pure core;
  no secret ever appears in it. Behind the `ui` extra.

- **Feedback loop and A/B onboarding** (WF-ADR-0006). `wayfinder-router onboard`
  A/B-tests a local vs hosted model on sample prompts and records your
  good-enough judgment; the gateway's `/v1/feedback` endpoint captures
  steady-state judgments. The label log *is* the `calibrate` dataset, so feedback
  turns straight into an updated config — collect → calibrate → route.

- **Scheduled recalibration with live hot-reload** (WF-ADR-0007).
  `wayfinder-router recalibrate` re-fits the routing config from the feedback log
  (run it from cron or a k8s CronJob, or click *Recalibrate & save* in the UI);
  it rewrites only the `[routing]` section and **preserves** your `[gateway]`
  endpoints. A running gateway hot-reloads the new config with no restart, and a
  malformed mid-flight write keeps the last-good config.

- **Deployable packaging** (WF-ADR-0008). A slim `Dockerfile` runs the gateway as
  a sidecar or service (only the `gateway` extra), with a `docker-compose`
  example that persists config + the feedback log and shows the recalibrate
  one-shot. The library runs in-process; the CLI, UI, and onboarding are the
  operator/bootstrap surfaces. Install extras: `gateway`, `ui`, `dev`.

### Boundary

- Wayfinder scores deterministically and **recommends**; it never invokes a
  model, selects a provider, reads a credential, or tokenizes per a vendor model
  — the caller runs inference (WF-ADR-0001 / RAC ADR-070). The deterministic core
  imports no web or SDK code; only the optional gateway and UI layers touch the
  network or keys, and only from the environment.
